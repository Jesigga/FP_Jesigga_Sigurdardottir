## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Data Set}
taylor_album_songs <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-10-17/taylor_album_songs.csv')

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Tidy Data for Research Questions}
certan_rows = subset(taylor_album_songs, select = c(album_name, album_release, artist, 
featuring, danceability, energy))
Taylor_clean_data <- certan_rows %>%
  filter(!is.na(album_name)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(artist)) %>%
  arrange(desc(album_release))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r Danceability Vs Energy}
ggplot(Taylor_clean_data) +
  aes(x = danceability, y = energy) +
  geom_jitter(size = 1.5) +
  labs(
    x = "Energy",
    y = "Danceability",
    title = "Danceability Vs Energy"
  ) +
  theme_linedraw()  
```





```{r Album Release vs Featured Artist}
Taylor_clean_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(featuring)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = album_release, y = featuring) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(
    x = "Album Release",
    y = "Featured Artist",
    title = "Album Release vs Featured Artist"
  ) +
  theme_linedraw()
```
